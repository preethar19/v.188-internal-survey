Generally there is a lack of communication and yet when you don’t do something in the exact way that certain editors want there seems to be a passive aggressive response from them. I like what Indo at the Chronicle but if I didn’t the actual practice of doing what I do I wouldn’t be a member because the environment is not fun and I often feel under appreciated. It feels like kids (barely legal adults) running other kids and the power dynamic is atrocious. It is very clear that people do not respect other people’s time.

Q32 - Please briefly explain why you are undecided OR do not intend to work at The Chronicle a year from now
Please briefly explain why you are undecided OR do not intend to work at The Chronicle a year from now
I have a good relationship with the current EIC and am hesitant about who the next one might be
Again I like my job but at the chronicle I feel very under appreciated. So if this feeling gets to be to great it might be healthier for me to quit especially since I’m literally doing it for free because I like doing it but then I have also been asked by people who are not in the Chronicle if I freelance.
not sure with other time commitments
"too big of a time commitment "
I don't know if writing is the right avenue for me to reach my goals in sports media.
Unsure if I will be here
"I’m a DKU student "
"Next year is my last year here, and having already been upper mast I'm not sure there's another position for me"
"No reason, depends on how busy I would be."
Workload balance
"This will depend on course load, opportunities to conduct research"
Graduating

Please briefly explain why you are undecided OR do not intend to apply for leadership positions at The Chronicle
I am not sure what my commitment levels will be next year timing-wise
Being a graduate student I feel I would not have time to carry on a leadership position.
I don't know how much time I want to commit to Chron in future years
I only have one more year and I’m not sure if I will be qualified for a leadership position.
If I stay at the Chronicle then yes I do intend to apply for leadership to help mitigate some of the aforementioned issues
"No time "
"Need to evaluate time commitment "
"time commitment "
I don't think I have the time to devote to a leadership position
Gonna graduate
I am unsure of responsibilities of other positions and how the my role would change
content with where i am
"I may go another direction next year, and either way I don't feel comfortable taking on that much work."
"Imight depending on how this semester goes "
sdlkfgj
too many commitments already
I have too many commitments
"I want to focus on writing instead of editing "
I have a lower level leadership position that I am comfortable with the requirements of and I feel others are more involved than me and would do a better job in upper level positions
"I’m a DKU student and my future is unclear "
I'll be a senior and will try to be moving at my own pace
I want to leave the spot open for someone else
"Currently on upoermasthead and unsure where I’d like to go leadership wise from here "
"No real reason, just want this to be a small hobby on the side."
"Will be abroad in the fall, but may be interested the following year"
Don’t feel like it
I do not attend to apply for a leadership position because I am a Graduate student who plans on graduating Spring 2024.
Not sure if I want to continue
"I am working on handling my current workload, unsure that I could take on more"
I like writing more than editing
I want a break next year lol
Time commitment might be too high
I much prefer writing to editing.
